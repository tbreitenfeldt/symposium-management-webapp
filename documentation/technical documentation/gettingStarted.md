## 2.0. How to Get Set up



### 2.1. Creating the Database
For creating the database, you will need to use our SQL file. The SQL file is called "conference_manager.sql" and is located in the root folder of this project. After it is downloaded into phpmyadmin or another service the database will be ready to use.


### 2.2. Changing the HTTP Requester Domain for the Proxies
The HTTP Requester's domain is used to give the Proxies the main link to the root folder for the application. You will find the HTTP Requester file within the 'application/proxies' folder. 
If this project is not being used or tested through localhost or is being renamed, the domain will have to be changed. Enter in your own link instead of the current one to allow for the proxies to work.


### 2.3. Configure Database Credentials



### 2.4. Change config.php
